<p>Hello! My name is Srey Keosopheaktra, and I'm a 24-year-old international student currently living in Kumamoto, Japan. I’ve recently embarked on an exciting journey to pursue my career as a web developer and designer, and this website marks the beginning of my professional portfolio.</p>

<p>As for my personality, I'm deeply passionate about creativity, meaningful connections, and making a positive impact through my work. I thrive on solving problems, designing intuitive user experiences, and bringing ideas to life through clean, functional code. My introspective nature helps me approach challenges with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, while my love for learning drives me to constantly improve my skills.  </p>

<p>Living in Japan has been an incredible experience, allowing me to immerse myself in a new culture while pursuing my academic and career goals. I’m inspired by the blend of tradition and innovation here, and I aim to reflect that balance in my work as a developer and designer.  
</p>

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far—a space where I can showcase my projects, share my growth, and connect with others who share my passion for technology and design. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it!  <br />

  Feel free to reach out—I'd love to hear from you!  <br />
